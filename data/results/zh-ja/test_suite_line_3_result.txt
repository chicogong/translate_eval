Explanation:
1. "方法学" is translated as "方法論" (houhouron), which is the standard term in Japanese for methodology.
2. "双盲" is translated as "二重盲検" (nijuumouken), the standard term for double-blind in medical research.
3. "安慰剂对照研究" is translated as "プラセボ対照試験" (purasebo taishou shiken), using the standard Japanese term for placebo-controlled study.
4. The sentence structure is rearranged to follow Japanese SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) syntax, with the verb "採用しています" (saiyou shiteimasu) at the end.
5. The formal tone is maintained throughout the translation, appropriate for academic or technical writing.
