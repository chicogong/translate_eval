A arquitetura proposta adota uma abordagem baseada em microsserviços para aprimorar a escalabilidade e a tolerância a falhas.

Explanation of translation choices:

1. "该架构设计" is translated as "A arquitetura proposta" (The proposed architecture) to maintain a formal tone while sounding natural in Portuguese.

2. "采用" is rendered as "adota" (adopts) - a precise verb that conveys the concept of implementing a specific approach.

3. "基于微服务的方法" becomes "uma abordagem baseada em microsserviços" (a microservices-based approach) - using the standard technical term "microsserviços" and proper adjective-noun agreement.

4. "来增强" is translated as "para aprimorar" (to enhance) - using a more formal and precise verb than the literal "fortalecer".

5. "可伸缩性和容错性" is rendered as "a escalabilidade e a tolerância a falhas" (scalability and fault tolerance) - using standard technical terminology in Portuguese with proper article agreement.

The sentence structure follows natural Portuguese syntax, placing the subject first, followed by the verb and complement, with the purpose clause introduced by "para" (to).
